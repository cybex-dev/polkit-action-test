# Polkit Action Test

The purpose of this script(s) is for anyone to run it, and see how 
polkit actions are handled in an environment. 

NOTE: Change the package manager
open the file `bin/subAppPacman` and change the line `pacman -Syyu` to that of your package manager

Reason for the pacakage manager is this is a confirmed root user action, but it can be replaced with any action requiring root user priviledges

Hope this helps!
